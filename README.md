The L-BASIC programming language
======================

As you may imagine, this is a BASIC compiler. The language variant is reasonably close to QB64 but we're willing to break compatibility with programs from 1985 when needed.

Detailed instructions are currently omitted because this project is still in early development. In brief:

```
./build.sh
./out/lbasic myprog.bas
./myprog
```
